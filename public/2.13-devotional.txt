  <h1>Saved For Good Works: The Evidence of True Salvation</h1>

  <p>“For I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’ Then they themselves also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?’ Then He will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” - Matthew 25:42-46 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>The above seems like such a difficult teaching, but the reality is that good people do good things. By your actions, they will know you—or as the Lord said:</p>

  <p>“By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” - John 13:35 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Elsewhere, the Lord teaches concerning wolves in sheep's clothing:</p>

  <p>“You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.” - Matthew 7:16-19 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Although we are saved by grace, the Bible teaches that we are saved <em>unto</em> good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</p>

  <p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” - Ephesians 2:8-10 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;” - Matthew 3:8 (NASB 1995)</p>
