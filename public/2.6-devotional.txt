  <h1>The Only Way: One Path to the Father</h1>

  <p>“Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.’” - John 14:6 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>It is interesting how in our modern-day society, we have so many gurus, philosophers, and so-called "prophets" who CONTRADICT Jesus and the Bible's claim regarding the "right way" to worship and come to God.</p>

  <p>What are we to do? Is there really one "right" way to come to God?</p>

  <p>The Bible makes it clear from the onset that there is indeed a proper way to come to God, and God will NOT RESPECT just any way. Mind you, this principle was established long before Jesus was ever physically born in the New Testament.</p>

  <p>“So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground. Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.” - Genesis 4:3-5 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>God is very specific about what He will and will not accept. Thank God for our sake that Jesus was the perfect sacrifice, FULFILLING ALL THE DEMANDS OF THE LAW and the requirements necessary in order for GOD to legally DECLARE THE SINNER RIGHTEOUS.</p>

  <p>I say this so that your faith is strengthened. Rejoice! If you are a follower of Christ, your faith isn't based on myths or fables but is grounded in God's Word.</p>
