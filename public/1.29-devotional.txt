  <h1>The Enduring Word: God's Timeless Message</h1>

  <p>“For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” - 2 Peter 1:21</p>

  <p>“So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.” - Isaiah 55:11</p>

  <p>God's word is amazing. Below I have written some interesting facts regarding the Bible that Dr. David Jeremiah shared:</p>

  <p>“The familiar observation that the Bible is the best-selling book of all time obscures a more startling fact: the Bible is the best-selling book of the year, every year. Calculating how many Bibles are sold in the United States is a virtually impossible task, but a conservative estimate is that in 2005 Americans purchased some twenty-five million Bibles—twice as many as the most recent Harry Potter book.” (Daniel, R. "The Good Book Business," The New Yorker, 2006)</p>

  <p>In the U.S. alone, 50 Bibles are sold every minute, 72,000 are sold every day, and 26,000,000 are sold every year.</p> 
  
  <p>The Gideons alone, during 100 years of ministry, have distributed 1.6 billion copies of God's word in more than 190 countries around the globe. They are just one of many millions of people sharing the good news of Christ as revealed in the Bible!</p>

  <p>Written over 1,500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks of life—kings, farmers, historians, fishermen, prophets, and apostles—they wrote so that the words they recorded were nothing less than the very words of God. Yet, at the same time, because they were moved by the Spirit of God, the authors' own styles and personalities are evident in their languages.</p>

  <p>It was written in three languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek) and in four geopolitical regions (the Middle East, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Southern Europe). The first translation of the English Bible was in 1382 AD by John Wycliffe. The first printed Bible was in 1454 AD by Johannes Gutenberg, who invented the type mold for the printing press.</p>

  <p>The Bible was the first book ever printed! History shows that the development of European culture, and from there all of Western civilization, is based upon the Bible. The 10 Commandments are the cornerstone of jurisprudence, and the Sermon on the Mount is the foundation of morality and ethics around the world.</p>

  <p>Jesus' words are true:</p>

  <p>“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.” - Matthew 24:35</p>

  <p>“For, ‘ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.’ And this is the word which was preached to you. Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,” - 1 Peter 1:24 - 2:2</p>

  <p>The Bible is timeless since its very source is God Almighty, and the WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER!</p>

  <p>“I encourage you to make the study of God's word a priority in your life. It will always be the most influential book in the world because its message originated with God, and it resolves the most pressing human need, which is how to know God and be reconciled to Him. So may the words of this book, the Bible, fill your memory, rule your heart, and guide your feet. Read it slowly, frequently, and prayerfully. It is a mine of wealth, a paradise of glory, and a river of pleasure. It is given to you in this life, and it will be opened someday in the judgment and remembered forevermore.” - Dr. David Jeremiah</p>
