  <h1>The Consistency of Scripture: The Perfect Sacrifice</h1>

  <p>“So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the LORD of the fruit of the ground. Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell.” - Genesis 4:3-5 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Logically, if the Bible is indeed "inspired by God" as we are taught, then these scripture passages written thousands of years prior to Christ's birth should be in agreement with the New Testament.</p>

  <p>The resounding conclusion is that <strong>YES</strong>, indeed, the Bible's presentation regarding God's purpose and will for man is very clear from the onset until the very end. This is remarkable considering the book was written by over 40 writers across hundreds, and at times thousands, of years.</p>

  <p>This consistency is especially clear when it comes to salvation and the payment for sin. From the very first book of the Bible, God establishes what is an acceptable payment for sin and what is <strong>NOT</strong>.</p>

  <p><em>Hint:</em> Jesus was and is the perfect sacrifice for sin "slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8), lining up with all the requirements God laid out in the Old Testament laws regarding sacrifice (see Leviticus 4).</p>

  <p>In case you aren't understanding the reference, look at how John the Baptist introduced Jesus:</p>

  <p>“The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, ‘Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!’” - John 1:29 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>God's design for payment of sin from the beginning of the Bible is a specific sacrifice. Jesus is representative of what God would accept as payment for sin. All throughout the Old Testament, God is alluding to Jesus and what He would one day do for His people as the real High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16).</p>

  <p>“If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.” - 1 Peter 1:17-19 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <h3>A Prayer of Thanksgiving</h3>
  <p>Thank You, Lord Jesus, that You have paid for all my sins. Through You, we have access to God the Father and are forgiven of all our sins—past, present, and future.</p>

  <p>Thank You, Lord, that You paid the price for me and, as a result, I am promised Heaven and eternity with You.</p>

  <p>Father, I just want to say I love You and thank You for always being faithful. I pray that You strengthen and comfort those in need of You most. Help cleanse the conscience of anyone feeling guilty or bad. Give us the courage to face the day and whatever challenges it brings, knowing that the greatest challenge we can face, You have already overcome—which is death.</p>

  <p>Thank You that through You we have the victory and are more than conquerors.</p>

  <p>In Jesus' name I pray,<br>
  Amen.</p>
