The Shepherd's voice.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
At that time, the Feast of
Dedication took place at Jerusalem.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.560
It was winter, and Jesus was walking
in the temple in the ade of Solomon

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.300
till the Jews gathered around him and
said to him, how long will you keep

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.240
us in suspense if you are the Christ?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.410
Tell us plainly.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.630
Jesus answered them.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.660
I told you, and you do not believe.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.590
The works that I do in my father's
name, bear witness about me,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.400
but you do not believe because
you are not among my sheep.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.840
My sheep hear my voice and I
know them, and they follow me.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
I give them eternal life and they
will never perish, and no one

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.680
will snatch them outta my hand.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.290
My father, who has given them to me is
greater than all, and no one is able

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.480
to snatch him out of the father's hand.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.030
I and the father are one.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.710
John 10 22 through 30.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.980
Our Lord is so amazing, beautiful,
powerful, lovely, breathtaking,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.190
unfathomable, and unexplainable.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.400
Only he could speak the
words he said and mean them.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
Holy, holy, holy, holy,
holy is the Lord Our God.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.440
Jesus is Lord.

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.235
This song below explains it well.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:31.425

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:32.865
Hope is still work.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:34.664
House fires.

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:36.195
God good.

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:42.675
