  <h1>Ordinary People, Powerful Prayer</h1>

  <p>“Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months. Then he prayed again, and the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.” - James 5:17-18 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Consider the power of prayer.</p>

  <p>Elijah's name means “Yahweh is my God” (spelled Elias in some versions of the Bible). The story of his prophetic career in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reigns of Kings Ahab and Ahaziah is told in 1 Kings 17–19 and 2 Kings 1–2.</p>

  <p>If you look up the story of Elijah, you will find a man of great faith who also struggled with emotions just like we do—yet his prayers moved mountains.</p>

  <p>This verse is found in the Book of James. You should read the whole book; it is a great book filled with profound paradoxes and practical wisdom.</p>
