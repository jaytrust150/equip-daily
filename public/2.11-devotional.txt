  <h1>Guard Your Heart: The Reality of Deception</h1>

  <p>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons.” - 1 Timothy 4:1 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.” - Matthew 24:24 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Even false churches have “revivals.” Do not be deceived. By definition, being deceived means not knowing you are being lied to.</p>

  <p>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.” - 2 Corinthians 11:13-15 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Again, I am not talking about confusing a teaching error with a false teacher. However, be on guard, for even men holding Bibles from pulpits and using words such as "salvation" and "healing" can be ministers of the devil—“disguising themselves as servants of righteousness.”</p>

  <p><strong>So how can you tell the truth?</strong></p>

  <p>Well, Paul admonishes us to:</p>

  <p>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” - 2 Timothy 2:15 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Jesus warns why we might be deceived:</p>

  <p>“Jesus said to them, ‘Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God?’” - Mark 12:24 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>It is scary to say, but I have attended churches here in Florida that are packed, yet it is easy to tell the preacher is false. Sadly, many who attend are new believers and can’t see through the false teachings. Again, I am not talking about a preacher simply making a mistake, but a literal "pastor" deceiving and twisting God's words to mislead God’s sheep. Be on guard, and read the Word for yourself.</p>

  <p>“Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” - Acts 17:11 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Someone might ask, "Why are you stressing this, Jonathan?"</p>

  <p>I stress it because God stresses it in His Word. He mentions it in many of the letters and books of the Bible, warning us because these false teachers have hurt believers' walks with God by teaching doctrines of demons (often disguised as religion using the word "grace").</p>

  <p>As Paul commands Timothy:</p>

  <p>“Keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.” - 1 Timothy 1:19 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>And remember the verse I started with:</p>

  <p>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons.” - 1 Timothy 4:1 (NASB 1995)</p>
