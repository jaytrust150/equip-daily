  <h1>A Lamp Shining in the Darkness</h1>

  <p>“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

  <p>“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a peck-measure, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” - Matthew 5:14-16 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“For God, who said, ‘Light shall shine out of darkness,’ is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.” - 2 Corinthians 4:6 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Amen 🙏</p>

  <p>“So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” - 2 Peter 1:19-21 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>When we read the Bible, it does something; it is like a lamp shining in a dark place. The Word of God is just that: God's Word. If you find yourself in a "dark" place, turn to God's Word.</p>

  <p>“Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path.” - Psalm 119:105 (NASB 1995)</p>
