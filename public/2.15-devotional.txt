  <h1>Peace in Distress: Trusting God for Sleep</h1>

  <p>Try "pray reading" these verses if you are feeling the same way. We can use God's Word in prayer, and He will understand exactly what we mean. He is the author of all Scripture.</p>

  <p>“Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer. O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach? How long will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah.” - Psalm 4:1-2 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“But know that the LORD has set apart the godly man for Himself; The LORD hears when I call to Him. Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD.” - Psalm 4:3-5 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“Many are saying, ‘Who will show us any good?’ Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O LORD! You have put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound. In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O LORD, make me to dwell in safety.” - Psalm 4:6-8 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Remember: God sees you! El Roi!</p>
