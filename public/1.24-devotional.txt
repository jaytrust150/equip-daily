  <h1>Under Construction: God's Unfinished Masterpiece</h1>

  <p>“How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers! But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, But they are like chaff which the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the wicked will perish.” - Psalm 1:1-6</p>

  <p>“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.” - Philippians 1:6</p>

  <p>Thank God He is the Potter and we are the clay! We are His masterpiece, as the Bible tells us (Ephesians 2:10)! We ought not lose hope; though we might struggle, God's not done with us yet.</p>
