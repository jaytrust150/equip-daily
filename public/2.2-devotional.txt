  <h1>The Unchanging Promise: God is Faithful</h1>

  <p>“And Jesus answered and said to them, ‘It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.’” - Luke 5:31-32 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us.” - 2 Corinthians 1:20 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>The Bible is an amazing book, perfect even in our modern translations. It is the literal Word of God. From beginning to end, it is divinely inspired and interconnected. Even Jesus, when He spoke and taught, used the Scriptures.</p>

  <p>A.W. Tozer describes the purpose of the Bible beautifully:</p>

  <p>“The Bible is not an end in itself, but a means to bring men to an intimate and satisfying knowledge of God, that they may enter into Him, that they may delight in His Presence, may taste and know the inner sweetness of the very God Himself in the core and center of their hearts.” - A. W. Tozer</p>

  <p>Consider this warning from Jesus, which also contains a hidden gem of faithfulness:</p>

  <p>“In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out.” - Luke 13:28 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>While this is a stern warning, I want to focus on the positive implication found in the phrase: <strong>“When you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God.”</strong></p>

  <p>Why focus on that part? Because it proves that when God promises something, He ALWAYS keeps His Word (2 Corinthians 1:20). He keeps His promises even if they were given thousands of years earlier! In the book of Genesis, God made covenants with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Jesus confirms here that they are indeed in the Kingdom. God remained loyal to Abraham just as He promised in Genesis 17.</p>

  <p>“God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?” - Numbers 23:19 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>The phrase “weeping and gnashing of teeth” appears seven times in the New Testament (seven representing completeness). It is a dreadful image of separation from God. However, if you are reading this, have confessed Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9)!</p>

  <p><strong>Doubting your salvation?</strong></p>
  <p>You can assure yourself if you find the "fruit of repentance" (Matthew 3:8). To be clear, these are not religious works—praying a certain number of times a day or giving money. There are people who do religious works who will try to tell Jesus, "I did this or that in Your name," and He will clearly say, "I never knew you" (Matthew 7:22-23).</p>

  <p>True salvation is evidenced by actions that show the love of God and mark you as a disciple of Christ (John 13:35; Romans 14:17; 1 Corinthians 13:13), not by religious performance.</p>

  <p>Whatever your struggle, rejoice in knowing God never lies and always keeps His Word. Rest in this promise:</p>

  <p>“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, ‘I will never desert you, nor will I ever forsake you.’” - Hebrews 13:5 (NASB 1995)</p>
