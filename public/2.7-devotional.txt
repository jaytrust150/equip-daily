  <h1>Fishers of Men: The Work of God</h1>

  <p>“And He said to them, ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.’ Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.” - Matthew 4:19-20 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>This is Jesus speaking to some of His early disciples. I would hope that I would respond the same way Peter and Andrew did (Matthew 4:18): they left it all to follow the Lord and became “fishers of men.”</p>

  <p>It is interesting that as an evangelist (a person who spreads the gospel), you realize that just like fishermen use a certain type of bait to catch a certain type of fish, Jesus also teaches us to catch men using different types of "bait."</p>

  <p>It is funny how people came to Jesus seeking food, not necessarily seeking <em>Him</em>. Yet, He still performed miracles to draw them in. Even though He knew why they came, He didn't turn them away; He wanted them to believe in Him for salvation!</p>

  <p>“Jesus answered them and said, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.’” - John 6:26-27 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>If you read the chapter for more context, you will see the crowd asking how they can do the works of God. Jesus simplifies it for them:</p>

  <p>“Therefore they said to Him, ‘What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?’ Jesus answered and said to them, ‘This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.’” - John 6:28-29 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Of course, Jesus was speaking of Himself. Notice the capitalization—the Bible uses capital letters (e.g., "Him") to refer to God, even in pronouns.</p>
