  <h1>Christ's Righteousness: The Only Ground</h1>

  <p>“It is Jesus’ own righteousness, His performance and not my performance, that is the grounds of my justification.” — R.C. Sproul</p>

  <p>When a church tells you otherwise... stop going there.</p>

  <p>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.” - 2 Corinthians 11:13-15</p>

  <p>It's getting hard to discern false teachers from real ones... but an easy way to tell is what they preach... don't go by the signs and wonders, even if they cast out demons...</p>

  <p>“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.’” - Matthew 7:21-23</p>

  <p>I never understood these verses till I saw it with my own eyes... it's getting very hard to find Biblical Christianity... the fake stuff looks so real it's scary, but I trust God. Even amongst these fake churches are real Christians... if you find yourself in a church always feeling the pastor is preaching a works (have to be good) to go to heaven gospel... RUN 🏃‍♂️ 💨 away...</p>
