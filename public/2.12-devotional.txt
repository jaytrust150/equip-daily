  <h1>Riches for Rags: The Value of Knowing Christ</h1>

  <p>“But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:” - Philippians 3:7-9 (KJV)</p>

  <p>I love how the above verses are phrased. Paul says that he counts all the religious accolades and those things that he was once proud of as "dung."</p>

  <p>He is literal here—the Greek word is <em>skubalon</em>, translated as "dung," which literally means animal refuse or poop. That is why I like the KJV translation here; it doesn't sugarcoat it.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, all those things (Philippians 3:5-6) about which Paul once boasted are "dung" compared to knowing Christ Jesus!</p>

  <p>That is one of the beautiful things about our Lord! He is always more worthy than anything the world could ever offer.</p>

  <p>“For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?” - Matthew 16:26 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>He is faithful and true always. Never trade riches for rags!</p>

  <p>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.” - Matthew 13:45-46 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.” - Hebrews 11:6 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Nothing compares with knowing God spiritually, emotionally, and in every sense you can imagine. #thankful</p>
