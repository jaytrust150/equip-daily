  <p>Here is another devotional I enjoyed while writing my Equip Daily Devotionals, taken from <em>Turning Point</em> with Dr. David Jeremiah.</p>

  <p><strong>Turning Point with Dr. David Jeremiah</strong></p>

  <p>“Lift up your heads, O gates, And be lifted up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!” - Psalm 24:7 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>The gates in Psalm 24 refer to the gates of Jerusalem, which are to be opened wide for the triumphant entry of the King of Glory. The ultimate fulfillment of this will be at the moment of the Second Coming at the end of the Tribulation. Christ’s feet will light upon the Mount of Olives (Zechariah 14:4), and He will enter Jerusalem through the eastern gate (Ezekiel 44:2).</p>

  <p>There’s a spiritual application to this. When many around us are slumped in despair, we who know of our Lord’s return are lifting up our heads. In referring to the signs of His return, Jesus said, “Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near” (Luke 21:28).</p>

  <p>Psalm 121:1 says, “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help” (KJV).</p>

  <p>The world’s in bad shape, but the King of Glory is coming! Lift up your head, your heart, your eyes, and your spirits! Rejoice as you await His coming!</p>
