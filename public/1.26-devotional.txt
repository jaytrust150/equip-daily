  <h1>Good vs. Forgiven: The Gift of Grace</h1>

  <p>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.” - Ephesians 2:1-3</p>

  <p>“But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.” - Ephesians 2:4-7</p>

  <p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” - Ephesians 2:8-10</p>

  <p>“I've heard a couple pastors say, good people don't go to heaven, forgiven people go to heaven. Meaning, good works won't get you there, asking forgiveness of your sins and repenting is the key.” - Jim Rocco</p>

  <p>A good friend of mine shared the above when he was talking to a friend of his who told him something along the lines of, “Hopefully I make it to heaven; I’m a good person!”</p>
  
  <p>I love what he responded and asked permission to share it here… because it is so true!</p>

  <p>Read it again if you don’t get it…</p>
