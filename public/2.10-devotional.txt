  <h1>God in Control: Future Foretold</h1>

  <p>“And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not damage the oil and the wine.’” - Revelation 6:6 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>It is amazing how the Bible predicts and dictates the future.</p>

  <p>If the Bible makes one thing clear, it is that God is in control... even when it comes to future prices during the Great Tribulation.</p>
