  <h1>Sanctification: Partakers of the Divine Nature</h1>

  <p>“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.” - John 10:10</p>

  <p>Being a Christian and pursuing certain careers is hard! I mean, the more you come to know God, the more He changes who you are. The Bible calls this process Sanctification.</p>
  
  <p>Before being a Christian, I could sin and couldn't care less. That's how most people live, which is also the reason ALL humans are called to REPENT—to turn to God—because what bothers God doesn't bother them.</p>

  <p>What do I mean? Well, if you ponder my next question, I think you will understand what I mean... Why is it that some people don't care about what God considers sin? For example, some people have no problem lying, cheating, or being nasty or mean. (Read the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5, for a better explanation of sin.)</p>

  <p>The Bible explains it like this:</p>

  <p>“Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.” - Ephesians 2:3</p>

  <p>We, too, were all like that before becoming Christians (being born again). The Bible claims a distinction between Christians and non-Christians. The main difference being that Christians are BORN AGAIN—we are born into God's family. Don't believe me? Believe Jesus:</p>

  <p>“Jesus answered and said to him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.’” - John 3:3</p>

  <p>So according to Scripture, we "were by nature children of wrath," but then God gave us new birth.</p>

  <p>“For you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.” - 1 Peter 1:23</p>

  <p>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” - 2 Peter 1:4</p>

  <p>Okay, so what's my point? Well, back to what I began with: once you become a Christian, God changes you. What used to not bother you now bothers you. We are "partakers of the divine nature," the Bible says.</p>

  <p>This is how you can spot FAKE PREACHERS: they don't emphasize the work of the Spirit but the works of the law/man. If they weren't telling you that you were bad all the time, they would have nothing to preach about!</p>

  <p>Anyhow, back to what I began with. Imagine trying to be a used car salesman after being born again. You couldn't sell people bad cars (not that that's what used car salesmen do... but just saying!). You couldn't be a thief anymore; your conscience would bother you! You wouldn't feel right being anything but how Jesus is.</p>

  <p>Amen!</p>
