  <h1>Spent for Souls: The Logic of Love</h1>

  <p>“I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?” - 2 Corinthians 12:15 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>If I love you more, would you love me less?</p>

  <p>Paul poses this question because he is explaining the depth of his love for the Corinthians. He wasn't seeking their approval or their resources; he was seeking their spiritual well-being.</p>

  <p>“All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Actually, it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved.” - 2 Corinthians 12:19 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Paul’s purpose was to serve those whom he ministered to. This is the heart of true ministry and Christian living.</p>

  <p>I want to be like Paul—or even better, like Jesus, who literally gave Himself up for us.</p>

  <p>“And walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.” - Ephesians 5:2 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>How do you demonstrate your love for others? Christ gave us a pattern and an example! WWJD (What Would Jesus Do)?</p>

  <p>God bless you today if you’re reading this!</p>
