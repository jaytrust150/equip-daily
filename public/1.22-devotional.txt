  <h1>Mercy in Action: God Sees Our Hearts and Hands</h1>

  <p>“Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, ‘You are a God who sees’; for she said, ‘Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?’” - Genesis 16:13 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,’ and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.” - James 2:14-17 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.” - James 2:26 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Just a friendly reminder: live out your faith! Let your light shine before men so they glorify your Father in heaven! You are the light of the world, our Lord tells us! Shine 🌟</p>

  <p>“Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.” - Matthew 5:7 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>The above is Jesus speaking, so you can count on it! The God of the Bible does NOT lie; whatever He promises, He will do! Remember to show mercy—God sees! El Roi!</p>
