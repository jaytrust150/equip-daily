  <h1>Abba, Father: The Heart of a Good Parent</h1>

  <p>“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.” - Ephesians 1:2-3 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>“Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father!’” - Galatians 4:6 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Oh, what an amazing thought! The Creator of the universe, God Almighty, considers us His children.</p>

  <p>Anyone who has had good parents, or is a parent, knows what that means. The love of a parent toward their child is incredible. Now, begin to imagine how God must feel toward us who are called His children... Mind you, He demonstrated this through the cross.</p>

  <p>“If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!” - Matthew 7:11 (NASB 1995)</p>

  <p>Because He is our Father, we should never hesitate to ask God for anything. However, we must also realize that He might say "no" if it isn't good for us—just like a good parent does.</p>

  <p>God always has our best interests in mind; remember this when you pray to Him. Whether He allows us to go through hard times or blesses us with good moments, at the end of the day, God knows what He is doing, and it will all work out for our good.</p>

  <p>Consider the powerful assurance in these verses:</p>

  <p>“In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words; and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</p>

  <p>And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.</p>

  <p>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?” - Romans 8:26-32 (NASB 1995)</p>
