  <h1>Render to God What is God's</h1>

  <h3>Matthew 22:15-22</h3>

  <p>Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said. 16 And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any. 17 Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?” 18 But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, “Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites? 19 Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.” And they brought Him a denarius. 20 And He said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” 21 They said to Him, “Caesar’s.” Then He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.” 22 And hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.</p>

  <p>God doesn't want your money; He wants <i>you</i>. "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's."</p>

  <p>Jesus taught that the coin was Caesar's because it had Caesar's inscription on it. The Bible says we are created in God's image, so by Jesus' logic, that means we are God's; we belong to Him for we were created in His image.</p>

    <p>“So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” - Genesis 1:27</p>

  <p>In the New Testament, Peter tells us God is after YOU!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“But you are A CHOSEN PEOPLE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR GOD’S OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” - 1 Peter 2:9</p>
