  <p>
    "The garbage is gone!"
  </p>

  <p>
    A fresh start! The above is what my wife yelled at me after noticing the garbage collectors had picked up the trash from the curb. This is significant because I had overpacked the garbage cans this week.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was worried, wondering if they would actually take the trash. I wish I had a picture to show how there were literally bags overflowing from the sides and stacked above where the lid closes. I was so relieved to hear her yell, "The garbage is gone!"
  </p>

  <p>
    As we start the new year, I'm reminded that's what Christ did and continues to DO for us; it's a part of the gospel package. He takes the garbage away! "The garbage is gone!"...
